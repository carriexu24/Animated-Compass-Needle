# Animated-Compass-Needle
Animate the needle taking the shortest path from the current needle direction to the correct direction.

## Rules

You are to part of a team developing animated compass needle. The API is simple: the compass needle is currently in some direction (between 0 and 359 degrees, with north being 0, east being 90), and is being animated by giving the degrees to spin it. If the needle is pointing north, and you give the compass an input of 90, it will spin clockwise (positive numbers mean clockwise direction) to stop at east, whereas an input of -45 would spin it counterclockwise to stop at north west.

## Examples

Git clone the repository and run the code in the terminal.

1. Return 90.

```
python compas.py 315 45
```

2. Return 90.

```
python compas.py 180 270
```

3. Return -135.

```
python compas.py 45 270
```
